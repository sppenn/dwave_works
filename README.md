My attempt at learning about the different problems that D-Wave quantum computers can solve. (dwavesys.com)

I'm very much a beginner when in it comes to quantum computing. I've read a couple of books and taken an online class. 
This github repository is where I am storing and will store code that interacts with D-Wave machines.  I have the Ocean SDK installed,
but as of May 16, 2020 I haven't yet dabbled with Leap2. 

Here are some initial ideas I have for building my skills in writing Ocean applications.
   1. Write a XOR table using auxiliary variables
   2. Write code to simulate the prisoner's dilemma
   3. Write some code to list out all possibilities in building armies for some of the games I play.
   4. Pick a state in the US with a fair amount of counties, convert the map to a graph, and write code for a vertex covering exercise.
